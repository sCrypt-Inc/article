# sCrypt IDE 1.14.0 released

Today we released **sCrypt IDE 1.14.0** version with the following improvements:


## Optimize compilation speed

For some larger contracts, the previous compiled version takes longer to compile, such as the contract [p2gpk.scrypt](https://github.com/sCrypt-Inc/boilerplate/blob/master/contracts/p2gpk.scrypt). Compilation time may take around `30` minutes. The optimized new version takes less than `2` minutes to compile <sup>1</sup>.


## Asynchronous compilation

Previously, the IDE used a synchronous compilation mode when compiling contracts. This leads to problems that affect the user experience such as GUI freezes and unresponsiveness when compiling large contracts. The new version adopts the mode of asynchronous compilation. Even if it takes a long time to compile the contract, there will be no lag or no response.

## Added vscode command

The new version adds the vscode command: `Restart sCrypt LSP server`. This command can be used to restart the IDE's language server ([Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)). Even when some unknown abnormal problem causes the GUI to become unresponsive, you can restart the language server with this command. to return to normal.


Welcome to the new version, happy coding!
